# hello_world
This is my first repository. I am using this repository to understand branching, making and committing changes, and opening pull requests on GitHub. What I missed the first time around is the collaborative piece, especially as branches are concerned.

I am developing my coding skills. When I first started this repository I was studying Python, JavaScript, and SQL. I'm currently studying Java language, Spring Boot and Angular 6 Frameworks as well as continuing to improve Python programming. In addition to coding skills I am brushing up on mathematics, espeicially linear algebra and statistics.
